# P.A.W. Book Store Project

## Description
The basic architecture is a webstore from a client-server paradigm. The software
will consist of two major components. First, the REST API is built on top of the
MVC paradigm which will serve as a way of communication with the storefront
using requests and responses over the HTTP protocol, and the second as a
storefront.

The API offers a full range of e-commerce options making it possible for
customers to view books and sell books, add books to a cart, and check out. For
store owners, the platform includes a management dashboard to manage books,
purchases and employee
